# Procedural Audio

## Definitions


"Sound qua process, as opposed to sound qua product."

"Procedural audio is non-linear, often synthetic sound, created in real time according to a set of programmatic rules and live input."


Defining in terms of:

- Recorded sound
- Interactive, non-linear and adaptive sound
- Sequenced sound
- Synthetic sound
- Generative sound
- Stochastic sound
- Algorithmic sound
- AI sound 


"... a system that has a complex internal states with memory and goals, designed to produce a range of sound outputs for a range of inputs.“

"The thesis of this book is that any sound can be generated from first principles, guided by analysis and synthesis. An idea evolving from this is that, in some ways, sounds so constructed are more realistic and useful than recordings because they capture behaviour. Although considerable work is required to create synthetic sounds with comparable realism to recordings the rewards are astonishing. Sounds which are impossible to record become accessible. Transformations are made available that cannot be achieved th[r]ough any existing effects process. And fantastic sounds can be created by reasoned extrapolation. This considerably enhances the palette of the traditional sound designer beyond mixing and applying effects to existing material to include constructing and manipulating virtual sound objects. By doing so the designer obtains something with a remarkable property, something that has deferred form. Procedural sound is a living sound effect that can run as computer code and be changed in real time according to unpredictable events. The advantage of this for video games is enormous, though it has equally exciting applications for animations and other modern media."

## Practicals

### Fire

#### Sound components

• lapping — combustion of gases in the air, on the combustion front (flames) 

• crackling — small scale explosions caused by stresses in the fuel

• hissing — regular outgassing, release of trapped vapour

• bubbling — boiling of liquids 

• creaking — internal stress of fuel expansion or nearby structures 

• fizzing — aerial conflagration of small particles

• whining — periodic relaxations during outgassing

• roaring — low-frequency turbulent cycles of flames 

• popping — gaseous phase explosion where heat and pressure are in phase 

• clattering — settling of fuel under gravity

# Software

- [Audacity](https://www.audacity.de/)

- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (command line program)

  - on MacOS installation via [brew](https://brew.sh/) 
     `brew install ffmpeg` after installing brew
     
  - on Linux via `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

  - to participate within from Windows you can either get [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/install-win10) to get a Linux shell inside of your Windows environment or install Linux in a Virtual Machine (e.g. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)). We recommend Ubuntu for ease of use and installation. Both installations will take some time so you will need to prepare this beforehand. When using WSL you can run `explorer.exe .` to use Explorer to browse files in your current WSL working directory.

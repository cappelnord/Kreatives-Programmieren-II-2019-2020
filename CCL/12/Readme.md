## Practicals

## Software

- [Audacity](https://www.audacity.de/)

- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (command line program)

  - on MacOS installation via [brew](https://brew.sh/)
     `brew install ffmpeg` after installing brew

  - on Linux via `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

- to participate from within Windows you can either get [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/install-win10) to get a Linux shell inside of your Windows environment or install Linux in a Virtual Machine (e.g. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)). We recommend Ubuntu for ease of use and installation. Both installations will take some time so you will need to prepare this beforehand. When using WSL you can run `explorer.exe .` to use Explorer to browse files in your current WSL working directory.

### Shell Commands

- `echo`:  print something in your terminal
	- `echo "hi there"`

- `mkdir`: make a new directory
	- `mkdir desiredfoldername`

- `cd`: Change directory
- `pwd`: print working (or current) directory
- `nano`: Text-Editor inside the terminal
	- `nano yourfilename` open a file in nano
	- `nano` open nano with a blank (not yet saved) file
		- Ctrl-O: WriteOut File
		- Ctrl-X: Exit Nano

- `hexdump`: print a file's data in hexadecimal format

	- `hexdump -C yourfilename`

	- `hexdump -C -n 64 yourfilename` --> `-n 64` specifies how many bytes to get

 - `cat`: print the data of a file
 - `head`: print part of a file's data
	-   `head -c 64 yourfilename`

- `ffmpeg`: command line media tool
	- `ffmpeg -i yourinput youroutputfile`
	- `ffmpeg -f yourdesireddataformat -s 'width'x'height' -pix_fmt yourpixelformat -i yourinput youroutputfile`

- `|` (a pipe): "pipes" data from one command's output stream into a second command's input
	- `head -c 64 yourfilename | ffmpeg -f rawvideo -s 8x8 -pix_fmt gray -i - youroutputfile`: pipe 64 bytes from a file to ffmpeg and display them as grayscale image (8-bit per pixel) on a square matrix (8 x 8)
	- `head -c 64 yourfilename | ffmpeg -f rawvideo -s 8x8 -pix_fmt gray -i - -vf scale=500:500 -sws_flags neighbor -y youroutputfile`: same as above but scaled to a larger matrix

### 'i am sitting in a mp3'

Based on Alvin Lucier's [I Am Sitting In A Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAxHlLK3Oyk), we want to take a mp3-soundfile and recursively compress it using the mp3-encoder again and again.

For that you first need a (preferably short) mp3-file.

Place it in a directory you want to be working in.

Also create a new folder called `out` for our output files, as we will create lots of audio files and we don't want to mess up our current working directory.

Now open nano (or any text editor of your choice) to write the following shell-script:

```
#! /bin/sh

f=./yourfile.mp3

for i in {0..99}
do
  ffmpeg -i $f ./out/youroutputfile$i.mp3

  # Since successive copies will get progressively quieter we recommend using
  # the 'loudnorm' filter for normalisation if installed on your system:

  # ffmpeg -i $f -af loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11 ./out/youroutputfile$i.mp3

  f=./out/youroutputfile$i.mp3

  echo "written to $f"
done
```

Save this file as `yourshellscriptfilename.sh`.

Then, in the terminal run:
`bash yourshellscriptfilename.sh`

or:

`chmod +x yourshellscriptfilename.sh`
and then:
`./yourshellscriptfilename.sh`

Your `out` folder should now be full with mp3-files numbered from 0-99. Can you hear the artifacts of the recursively applied mp3-compression?
